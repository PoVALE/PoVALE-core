/**
 * This is the base Predicate class which handles predicates on our system.
 * <p>
 * Predicates, along with functions, are one of the main building blocks
 * of the system.
 * <p>
 * Usage: predicates must extend this base class, and usually implement two
 * methods: {@link #getName()} and another method which must contain the
 * {@link CallableMethod} annotation. See the sample
 * {@link TruePredicate} for more details.
 * <p>
 * The result in getName will provide the (unqualified) predicate name, to
 * be appended to the plugin package name in order to be used in the XML
 * documents.
 * <p>
 * The main entry point from the system is the {@link #call(Entity...)}
 * method, which finds the appropriate annotated method and calls it. In
 * case several such methods exist (which might happen if there are more
 * than one CallableMethod-annotated methods), all of them are tried
 * before giving up with a RuntimeException.
